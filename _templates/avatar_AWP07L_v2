 For devices purchased since January 2020.
 
 This device is easy to open through two screws.
 It contains a compact PCB that has *NO* specific locations for (temporary) pins for easy programming,
 and the PCB seems tightly fixed in  the housing.
 The photo below shows how programming wires can be soldered directly onto the ESP module.
